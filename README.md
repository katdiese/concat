The purpose of Concat is to create a space for developers to meet other developers to either mentor them, to find a developer to mentor, to find people to talk with about web development, or to collaborate with on future projects. It was created as an exercise in using Angular Directives and the John Papa design pattern.

The front end was created using http calls to a Mongo Database.
